# HDB Wrapper

A library that wraps the hdb hana database client. It's main features are:
-  Promises
-  Optional SQL wrapper for convenience
-  When using the SQL wrapper instead of plain SQL, there is an almost fully functional MockDb for jest included. Only Commit/Rollback do not work (as far as I know).

### Disclaimer
This is mainly used by me and projects I work on. There could be big issues with the implementation or documentation I haven't noticed because I simply don't use it that way.

So use at your own risk and if some feature or documentation is missing/faulty/etc.: PR's are welcome!
